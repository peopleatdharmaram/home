The students used to drink that water. But now the hand pump is not working due to the lack of under ground water so another bore well was drilled for drinking purpose but this bore-well is giving the salt water. Though it is not useful for drinking, but still the students are drinking the same salt water even now.<div><br/></div><div><span>    For the school we have one <i>gram</i>-<i>panchayat </i>drinking water tap connection. Though the water comes regularly from the village water tank <span>everyday, </span>we don't have storage tank in our school to store that water. if we have a water tank on the school building, students can get the chance to drink sweet water using taps. The total cost for this development may not exceed 10,000 rupees.</span></div><div>Currently, the students are drinking the water with washing mugs and it is causing water diseases for the students as they need to put their hands into the drums, thus causing the contamination of water due their hands.</div><div><br/></div><div><span>    So, this problem can be solved, if we can have a water tank for the students to drink sweet water through the taps.</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><small>Updated on <abbr class="updated" title="2016-05-25T00:01:57.784Z">May 25, 2016</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:ddharmaram@gmail.com">dongala dharmaram</a></span></span> (Version <span class="sites:revision">5</span>)</small><br /><br /></div></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
